# OneSC (One tool to Simulate Cells) 

### Introduction
OneSC is a 2-in-1 computational tool that does two things:
1. Infer a functional transcription factors circuit that describe cell state transitions in the single-cell expression data
2. Simulate synthetic single-cell expression profiles that mimic cell state transitions using the core transcription factors circuit as regulatory backbone
