# OneSC (One tool to Simulate Cells) 

OneSC is a 2-in-1 computational tool that does two things:

1. Infer a functional transcription factors circuit that describe cell state transitions in the single-cell expression data

2. Simulate synthetic single-cell expression profiles that mimic cell state transitions using the core transcription factors circuit as regulatory backbones

You can read more about it in our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.31.596831v1).
