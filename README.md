# OneSC (One tool to Simulate Cells) 

OneSC is a 2-in-1 computational tool that does two things:

1. Infer a functional transcription factors circuit that describe cell state transitions in the single-cell expression data

2. Simulate synthetic single-cell expression profiles that mimic cell state transitions using the core transcription factors circuit as regulatory backbone

OneSC documentation is available through the link below.
